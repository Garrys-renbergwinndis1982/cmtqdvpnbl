Just walked out of Marching Powder, and wow, my head is honestly spinning. There's still that stale popcorn smell in my clothes, and I'm pretty sure some buttery crumbs have lodged themselves in my new sneakers. Ok, so. The theater was a bit too noisy with all that racket like a zoo having a panic attack, but it kinda just... added to the madness?

> You ever feel like you're being swept along like a leaf in a tornado? That was me the entire 18 hours (or however long it was, who knows) of this flick. I mean, there's that scene where the guy’s trying to smuggle coffee beans across borders – felt like some shoe designer trying to sneak the ugliest shoe ever into a fashion week. It made no sense, but it was genius.

Did I miss the point? Maybe. But Hugo Silkstone – or whatever his name was – had this wild vibe, like a raccoon that accidentally snorted a line of sugar when looking for garbage snacks. And that heart-pounding moment in the jungle chase scene... my spine is paying the price now, cramped since the credits rolled.

Man, the colors – so vibrant! Neon like candy wrappers on rainy streets at night. The whole thing felt more like an immersive dream; or a nightmare dressed in guilt, I guess.

Remembering someone told me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   but seriously, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . Get the full migraine-inducing experience, it’s worth it. 

> I'm sidelining here, but the soundtrack was like, IDK, like dubstep and whale noises got mashed in a blender, but oddly perfect with the frenetic pace. You just have to endure it, like wearing mismatched socks because life's too short to care about matching socks.

Oh! And pacing? Who needs it? Just chunk after chunk of bizarre chaos, but somehow that worked. Like jazz, or the shoe collection I once made from recycled tires. Terrifying but mesmerizing.

Alright, brain fading back to non-  thoughts now. Is it dinner time? Or breakfast? 
function accidentalPaste(whoops) { return nonsense; }

Just nothing made sense but all made sense, in that way life sometimes feels when you’re dizzy. Gotta go, my feet are like, liberate us from your eccentric theater-going ways, please!
